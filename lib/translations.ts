    "about.problem.title": "The Problem",
    "about.problem.description": "Things aren't that simple here. In my opinion, today's management system includes a huge number of problems. But let's call them inefficiencies, because truthfully, they're not really problems. Let's start our list\n\nAdministrators/Receptionists: These are the most thankless workers. Hiring an administrator is riskier than hiring a woman in her first week of pregnancy. It can definitely be said that the person who is the main channel of communication between the guest and the hotel takes on enormous responsibility. Guests often form their first impression of the brand based on the person who meets them and accompanies them during check-in. (And as we'll see later, these poor souls often harm the company and the entire brand rather than work for its development) Usually for a person, this is either a side job or temporary work. For this reason, these people are almost never engaged, and are also unreliable and irresponsible. I don't blame them, because their lack of motivation is easily explained. 80-95% of their work process is pure routine and repetitive, uninteresting tasks. Career growth prospects are extremely vague and ambiguous, and the salary rarely satisfies anyone. At the same time, there's a lot of useless work. For these reasons, these people don't stay in one place for long, often quit, ask for time off, sick leave. You have to spend money on searching, selecting, hiring, training these employees, and it's like a hamster wheel that wastes resources while staying in place (and in our case, we're even going backwards, not to mention improving, I'll explain why later). Most importantly - a tired employee can easily be rude to guests, or at the very least fail to provide the proper level of service. This affects hotel revenue much more significantly than it might seem. It would seem like a trifle, but imagine that on average such an employee, either from fatigue or from insufficient qualification level (we discussed above why this profession isn't rich in great talent) on average leaves 5 to 30 guests dissatisfied per day. This has a cumulative effect. Yes, LTV in the hospitality industry is one of the lowest, but with a sensible approach and the right tools, it can be significantly increased. Some hotels live entirely on repeat guests and losing even one of them can result in a substantial sum. In this case, we're not talking about lost earnings, but about vital risks for the business. This is absolutely serious. In general, we could talk about this for hours, I just want to convey the seriousness of this issue for every hotel.\n\nLost Bookings: Well, here everything is simple. Every day, a huge number of people make bookings and a considerable portion of them do so either late at night or early in the morning, when the administrator is not on site, and if some potential guests have questions that need to be clarified and they don't have the opportunity, these guests quickly move from the qualification of potential to undesirable, because they work in favor of your competitors. while you were unavailable, the dear guest simply went to a competitor who probably provided information to the guest as required or anticipated this question and reflected the information on the website (but usually even if the answer to the question is on your website, a person won't rummage through it looking for the answer to the cherished question, they want to get an answer immediately, instantly and without much effort). The most familiar and quick way to get an answer is to ask the administrator, who is either sleeping or busy checking in guests or something else. But let's assume our watchman is in touch and will answer the guest. Due to the limitations of our attention and reaction speed, they will most likely spend at least 2-3 minutes on an answer if the question is asked in chat and 10 seconds if they call by phone. At this stage, on average up to 80% of incoming requests are filtered out. And all this outrage at your expense. Unfair. And these workers shouldn't be blamed either. The specifics of this profession determine their limit of efficiency. Everyone is at a loss - you, the employee, and the guest. In a word - obscurantism\n\nOn this, our treatise on this profession doomed to imminent extinction has come to an end (not exactly) Now let's move on to its rebirth. Spoiler: It has a chance of survival.\n\nI mean that such people will definitely remain, even when robots replace us all. Remember the beauties and gentlemen standing behind the desk in all the films we know. This super professional is involved in the personal life of every guest. They know everything about everyone. They are empathetic, polite, neat, forgiving, while self-sufficient and know their worth. Giving each guest the opportunity to feel their own importance is a true art. Just try to find an approach to everyone. These employees, like pilots in the army, are very expensive. The company spends a lot of resources first to train them, and then to keep them. They do this through bonuses, corporate events, high salaries and other tools. But the fact remains, there are almost no such specialists on the market, like corrupt officials in Ukraine. all because such a person simply has nowhere to come from, no one seriously deals with training and proper maintenance of such personnel, except for some Ritz-Carlton or Waldorf Astoria, which are forced to do so by the need to match their status. I declare with full responsibility that now this has become available for ordinary hotels, boutiques, even hostels, not to mention the importance of such a person in large chains. This position in the hotel will definitely remain, just its role will change. This will be exactly the person I described to you in all colors a minute earlier. If we create such a person in the hotel, we will thereby kill several birds with one stone. Firstly, we will multiply the LTV of each guest, Secondly, we will get a crazy competitive advantage (I don't even know how correct this wording is, because when our solution becomes mass and reaches a certain level of coverage, we will simply increase the overall size of the pie. Due to personalized offers, the usual method of communication (we'll come back to this) people will stay in hotels more often and spend more there.)",

    "about.problem.title": "Проблема",
    "about.problem.description": "Здесь все не так просто. На мой взгляд сегодняшняя система управления включает огромное количество проблем. Но давайте будем называть их не эффективностями, потому-что по правде говоря проблемами они конечно не являются. Начнем наш список\n\nАдминистраторы/Ресепшионисты: Это самые неблагодарные работники. Нанимая администратора ты рискуешь больше, чем нанимая женщину на первой неделе беременности. Однозначно можно сказать что человек являющийся главным каналом коммуникации гостя с отелем берет на себя огромную ответственность. Часто гости формируют первое впечатление о бренде по человеку, который их встречает и сопровождает при заселении. (А как дальше мы увидим, часто эти бедняжки скорее вредят компании и всему бренду чем работает на ее развитие) Обычно для человека это является или подработкой или временной работой. По этой причине эти люди почти никогда не вовлечены, а также необязательны и безответственны. Я их не виню, ведь отсутствие у них мотивации легко обьяснимо. 80-95% их рабочего процесса это сплошная рутина и повторяющиеся, не интересные процессы. Перспективы карьерного роста крайне туманны и неоднозначны, а зарплата тоже редко кого устраивает. При этом бесполезной работы- много. По этим причинам эти люди долго не задерживаются на одном месте, часто увольняются, просят отгул, больничный. Приходится тратить деньги на поиск, отбор, найм, обучение этих сотрудников, и это походит на белку в колесе, которая растрачивает ресурсы при этом оставаясь на месте (а в нашем случае мы еще и идем в обратном направлении, не говоря уже о том чтобы совершенстоваться, дальше обьясняю почему). Что самое главное- уставший сотрудник легко может нахамить гостям, или по меньшей мере не обеспечить должный уровень обслуживания. Это отражается на доходах отеля гораздо более значительно чем может показаться. Казалось бы пустяк, по представьте что в среднем такой сотрудник толи от усталости, толи от недостаточного уровня квалификации (обсудили выше почему эта профессия небогата на крутые кадры) в среднем оставляет недовольными от 5 до 30 гостей в день. Это имеет накопительный эффект. Да, LTV в индустрии гостеприимства один из самых низких, но при толковом подходе и правильных инструментах его можно значительно повысить. Некоторые отели вообще живут только на повторяющихся гостях и потеря даже одного из них может повлечь за собой кругленькую сумму. В данном случае речь идет не о недозаработанных деньгах, а о жизненных рисках для бизнеса. Это абсолютно серьезно. Вообщем об этом можно говорить часами, я лишь хочу донести серьезность этого вопроса для каждого отеля.\n\nПотерянные бронирования: Ну, здесь все просто. Каждый день огромное количество людей совершают бронирования и немалая часть из них делают это или поздно ночью или рано утром, когда администратора нет на месте, и если у кого-то из потенциальных гостей появляются вопросы, которые нужно уточнить и у них нет такой возможности, то эти гости резко переходят из квалификации потенциальных в нежелательных, потому-что работают на руку вашим конкурентам. пока вы были недоступны, уважаемый гость просто ушел к конкуренту, который вероятно предоставил информацию гостю в обязательном порядке или же предугадал этот вопрос и отразил информацию на сайте (но обычно даже если ответ на вопрос есть на вашем сайте, человек не будет рыскать по нему и искать ответ на заветный вопрос, он хочет получить ответ сразу, мгновенно и при этом особо не утруждаясь). Самый привычный и быстрый вариант получить ответ- спросить у администратора, который или спит или занят заселением гостей или еще что-то. Но предположим, что наш сторожевой на связи и ответит гостю. В силу ограниченности нашего внимания и скорости реакции, он скорее всего потратит не менее 2-3 минут на ответ, если вопрос задан в чате и секунд 10 если звонят по телефону. На этом этапе отсеивается в среднем до 80% входящих запросов. И все это безобразие за ваш счет. Несправедливо. Да и работников этих тоже винить не стоит. Специфика этой профессии определяет их предел эффективности. Все в минусе, и вы, и сотрудник, и гость. Одним словом- мракобесие\n\nНа этом наш трактат об этой обреченной на скорейшее вымирание профессии подошел к концу (это не точно) Теперь перейдем к ее перерождению. Спойлер: У нее есть шанс на выживание.\n\nЯ имею ввиду что такие люди безусловно останутся, даже когда нас всех заменят роботы. Вспомните стоящих за стойкой красавиц и джентельменов во всеми известных нам фильмах. Этот супер профессионал вовлечен в личную жизнь каждого гостя. Он знает все о всех. Он эмпатичен, вежлив, опрятен, отходчив, при этом самодостаточен и знает себе цену. Дать возможность каждому из гостей ощутить собственную важность- это настоящее искусство. Пади попробуй найди к каждому подход. Эти сотрудники, как летчики в армии- очень дорогие. Компания тратит кучу ресурсов сначала на то, чтобы его обучить, а потом на то, чтобы удержать у себя. Делают они это через бонусы, корпоративы, высокие зарплаты и прочие инструменты. Но факт остается фактом, таких специалистов на рынке как коррупционеров в Украине- почти не осталось. все потому, что такому человеку просто неоткуда взяться, никто всерьез не занимается обучением и должным содержанием таких кадров, кроме какого-нибудь Ritz-Carlton или Waldorf Astoria, которых необходимость соответствовать статусу вынуждает это делать. Я с полной ответственностью заявляю что теперь это стало доступным и для рядовых отелей, бутиков, даже хостелов, не говоря уже о важности такого человека в крупных сетях. Эта позиция в отеле однозначно останется, просто ее роль изменится. Это будет именно тот человек, которого я вам во всех красках описывал минутой ранее. Если мы создадим такого человека в отеле, мы таким образом убьем сразу нескольких зайцев. Во первых, мы кратно увеличим LTV каждого гостя, Во вторых получим сумасшедшее конкурентное преимущество (я даже не знаю насколько эта формулировка корректна, потому-что когда наше решение станет массовым и достигнет определенного уровня покрытия, мы просто увеличим общий размер пирога. За счет персонализированных предложений, привычного метода общения (к этому еще вернемся) люди будут чаще останавливаться в отелях и больше там тратить.)",

    "about.problem.title": "Проблема",
    "about.problem.description": "Тут все не так просто. На мою думку сьогоднішня система управління включає величезну кількість проблем. Але давайте називатимемо їх неефективностями, тому що правду кажучи, проблемами вони звичайно не є. Почнемо наш список\n\nАдміністратори/Ресепшіоністи: Це найневдячніші працівники. Наймаючи адміністратора ти ризикуєш більше, ніж наймаючи жінку на першому тижні вагітності. Однозначно можна сказати що людина яка є головним каналом комунікації гостя з готелем бере на себе величезну відповідальність. Часто гості формують перше враження про бренд за людиною, яка їх зустрічає і супроводжує при заселенні. (А як далі ми побачимо, часто ці бідолахи скоріше шкодять компанії та всьому бренду ніж працює на її розвиток) Зазвичай для людини це є або підробіткою або тимчасовою роботою. З цієї причини ці люди майже ніколи не залучені, а також необов'язкові та безвідповідальні. Я їх не виню, адже відсутність у них мотивації легко пояснити. 80-95% їхнього робочого процесу це суцільна рутина та повторювані, нецікаві процеси. Перспективи кар'єрного зростання вкрай туманні та неоднозначні, а зарплата теж рідко кого влаштовує. При цьому марної роботи- багато. З цих причин ці люди довго не затримуються на одному місці, часто звільняються, просять відгул, лікарняний. Доводиться витрачати гроші на пошук, відбір, найм, навчання цих співробітників, і це схоже на білку в колесі, яка витрачає ресурси при цьому залишаючись на місці (а в нашому випадку ми ще й йдемо у зворотному напрямку, не кажучи вже про те щоб вдосконалюватись, далі пояснюю чому). Що найголовніше- втомлений співробітник легко може нахамити гостям, або принаймні не забезпечити належний рівень обслуговування. Це відображається на доходах готелю набагато більш значно ніж може здатися. Здавалося б дрібниця, але уявіть що в середньому такий співробітник то від втоми, то від недостатнього рівня кваліфікації (обговорили вище чому ця професія небагата на круті кадри) в середньому залишає незадоволеними від 5 до 30 гостей на день. Це має накопичувальний ефект. Так, LTV в індустрії гостинності один з найнижчих, але при толковому підході та правильних інструментах його можна значно підвищити. Деякі готелі взагалі живуть тільки на повторюваних гостях і втрата навіть одного з них може потягнути за собою кругленьку суму. В даному випадку мова йде не про недозароблені гроші, а про життєві ризики для бізнесу. Це абсолютно серйозно. Взагалі про це можна говорити годинами, я лише хочу донести серйозність цього питання для кожного готелю.\n\nВтрачені бронювання: Ну, тут все просто. Щодня величезна кількість людей здійснюють бронювання і чимала частина з них робить це або пізно вночі або рано вранці, коли адміністратора немає на місці, і якщо у когось з потенційних гостей з'являються питання, які потрібно уточнити і у них немає такої можливості, то ці гості різко переходять з кваліфікації потенційних у небажаних, тому що працюють на руку вашим конкурентам. поки ви були недоступні, шановний гість просто пішов до конкурента, який ймовірно надав інформацію гостю в обов'язковому порядку або ж передбачив це питання і відобразив інформацію на сайті (але зазвичай навіть якщо відповідь на питання є на вашому сайті, людина не буде рискати по ньому і шукати відповідь на заповітне питання, вона хоче отримати відповідь відразу, миттєво і при цьому особливо не втомлюючись). Найзвичніший і швидкий варіант отримати відповідь- запитати у адміністратора, який або спить або зайнятий заселенням гостей або ще щось. Але припустимо, що наш сторожовий на зв'язку і відповість гостю. В силу обмеженості нашої уваги та швидкості реакції, він швидше за все витратить не менше 2-3 хвилин на відповідь, якщо питання задане в чаті і секунд 10 якщо телефонують. На цьому етапі відсіюється в середньому до 80% вхідних запитів. І все це безобразіє за ваш рахунок. Несправедливо. Та й працівників цих теж винувачувати не варто. Специфіка цієї професії визначає їх межу ефективності. Всі в мінусі, і ви, і співробітник, і гість. Одним словом- мракобісся\n\nНа цьому наш трактат про цю приречену на найшвидше вимирання професію підійшов до кінця (це не точно) Тепер перейдемо до її переродження. Спойлер: У неї є шанс на виживання.\n\nЯ маю на увазі що такі люди безумовно залишаться, навіть коли нас всіх замінять роботи. Згадайте красунь та джентльменів, що стоять за стійкою у всіх відомих нам фільмах. Цей супер професіонал залучений в особисте життя кожного гостя. Він знає все про всіх. Він емпатичний, ввічливий, охайний, поступливий, при цьому самодостатній і знає собі ціну. Дати можливість кожному з гостей відчути власну важливість- це справжнє мистецтво. Спробуй знайди до кожного підхід. Ці співробітники, як льотчики в армії- дуже дорогі. Компанія витрачає купу ресурсів спочатку на те, щоб його навчити, а потім на те, щоб утримати у себе. Роблять вони це через бонуси, корпоративи, високі зарплати та інші інструменти. Але факт залишається фактом, таких спеціалістів на ринку як корупціонерів в Україні- майже не залишилось. все тому, що такій людині просто звідки взятися, ніхто всерйоз не займається навчанням і належним утриманням таких кадрів, крім якогось Ritz-Carlton або Waldorf Astoria, яких необхідність відповідати статусу змушує це робити. Я з повною відповідальністю заявляю що тепер це стало доступним і для рядових готелів, бутиків, навіть хостелів, не кажучи вже про важливість такої людини у великих мережах. Ця позиція в готелі однозначно залишиться, просто її роль зміниться. Це буде саме та людина, яку я вам у всіх фарбах описував хвилиною раніше. Якщо ми створимо таку людину в готелі, ми таким чином вб'ємо відразу кількох зайців. По-перше, ми кратно збільшимо LTV кожного гостя, По-друге отримаємо божевільну конкурентну перевагу (я навіть не знаю наскільки це формулювання коректне, тому що коли наше рішення стане масовим і досягне певного рівня покриття, ми просто збільшимо загальний розмір пирога. За рахунок персоналізованих пропозицій, звичного методу спілкування (до цього ще повернемось) люди будуть частіше зупинятися в готелях і більше там витрачати.)",

    "about.mission.quote": "This is the most advanced ecosystem for hotels (especially chains) today.",
    "about.problem.title": "The Problem",
    "about.problem.description": "Things aren't that simple here. In my opinion, today's management system includes a huge number of problems. But let's call them inefficiencies, because truthfully, they're not really problems. Let's start our list\n\nAdministrators/Receptionists: These are the most thankless workers. Hiring an administrator is riskier than hiring a woman in her first week of pregnancy. It can definitely be said that the person who is the main channel of communication between the guest and the hotel takes on enormous responsibility. Guests often form their first impression of the brand based on the person who meets them and accompanies them during check-in. (And as we'll see later, these poor souls often harm the company and the entire brand rather than work for its development) Usually for a person, this is either a side job or temporary work. For this reason, these people are almost never engaged, and are also unreliable and irresponsible. I don't blame them, because their lack of motivation is easily explained. 80-95% of their work process is pure routine and repetitive, uninteresting tasks. Career growth prospects are extremely vague and ambiguous, and the salary rarely satisfies anyone. At the same time, there's a lot of useless work. For these reasons, these people don't stay in one place for long, often quit, ask for time off, sick leave. You have to spend money on searching, selecting, hiring, training these employees, and it's like a hamster wheel that wastes resources while staying in place (and in our case, we're even going backwards, not to mention improving, I'll explain why later). Most importantly - a tired employee can easily be rude to guests, or at the very least fail to provide the proper level of service. This affects hotel revenue much more significantly than it might seem. It would seem like a trifle, but imagine that on average such an employee, either from fatigue or from insufficient qualification level (we discussed above why this profession isn't rich in great talent) on average leaves 5 to 30 guests dissatisfied per day. This has a cumulative effect. Yes, LTV in the hospitality industry is one of the lowest, but with a sensible approach and the right tools, it can be significantly increased. Some hotels live entirely on repeat guests and losing even one of them can result in a substantial sum. In this case, we're not talking about lost earnings, but about vital risks for the business. This is absolutely serious. In general, we could talk about this for hours, I just want to convey the seriousness of this issue for every hotel.\n\nLost Bookings: Well, here everything is simple. Every day, a huge number of people make bookings and a considerable portion of them do so either late at night or early in the morning, when the administrator is not on site, and if some potential guests have questions that need to be clarified and they don't have the opportunity, these guests quickly move from the qualification of potential to undesirable, because they work in favor of your competitors. while you were unavailable, the dear guest simply went to a competitor who probably provided information to the guest as required or anticipated this question and reflected the information on the website (but usually even if the answer to the question is on your website, a person won't rummage through it looking for the answer to the cherished question, they want to get an answer immediately, instantly and without much effort). The most familiar and quick way to get an answer is to ask the administrator, who is either sleeping or busy checking in guests or something else. But let's assume our watchman is in touch and will answer the guest. Due to the limitations of our attention and reaction speed, they will most likely spend at least 2-3 minutes on an answer if the question is asked in chat and 10 seconds if they call by phone. At this stage, on average up to 80% of incoming requests are filtered out. And all this outrage at your expense. Unfair. And these workers shouldn't be blamed either. The specifics of this profession determine their limit of efficiency. Everyone is at a loss - you, the employee, and the guest. In a word - obscurantism\n\nOn this, our treatise on this profession doomed to imminent extinction has come to an end (not exactly) Now let's move on to its rebirth. Spoiler: It has a chance of survival.\n\nI mean that such people will definitely remain, even when robots replace us all. Remember the beauties and gentlemen standing behind the desk in all the films we know. This super professional is involved in the personal life of every guest. They know everything about everyone. They are empathetic, polite, neat, forgiving, while self-sufficient and know their worth. Giving each guest the opportunity to feel their own importance is a true art. Just try to find an approach to everyone. These employees, like pilots in the army, are very expensive. The company spends a lot of resources first to train them, and then to keep them. They do this through bonuses, corporate events, high salaries and other tools. But the fact remains, there are almost no such specialists on the market, like corrupt officials in Ukraine. all because such a person simply has nowhere to come from, no one seriously deals with training and proper maintenance of such personnel, except for some Ritz-Carlton or Waldorf Astoria, which are forced to do so by the need to match their status. I declare with full responsibility that now this has become available for ordinary hotels, boutiques, even hostels, not to mention the importance of such a person in large chains. This position in the hotel will definitely remain, just its role will change. This will be exactly the person I described to you in all colors a minute earlier. If we create such a person in the hotel, we will thereby kill several birds with one stone. Firstly, we will multiply the LTV of each guest, Secondly, we will get a crazy competitive advantage (I don't even know how correct this wording is, because when our solution becomes mass and reaches a certain level of coverage, we will simply increase the overall size of the pie. Due to personalized offers, the usual method of communication (we'll come back to this) people will stay in hotels more often and spend more there.)",
